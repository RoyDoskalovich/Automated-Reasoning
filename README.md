# Automated-Reasoning

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various automated reasoning techniques and problem reductions in computer science. The focus is on converting complex problems into Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) instances and utilizing efficient transformation methods for logical formulas.

## Contents

### [Tseytin](./Tseytin)
Implementation of Tseytin transformation - a technique for efficiently converting propositional logic formulas to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) while preserving satisfiability.

### [SAT-Reduction](./SAT-Reduction)
Collection of implementations demonstrating how to reduce complex problems (Sudoku, Hamiltonian Cycle) to Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) instances.
